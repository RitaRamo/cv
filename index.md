# About me

Hey! My name is Rita, I am a last year PhD student at the University of Lisbon (IST) and University of Copenhagen (KU).

My current research interests focus on multilingual and multimodal learning. In previous work I have explored retrieval augmentation for the task of image captioning, aiming to reduce the number of trainable parameters and to adapt to out-of-domain settings without explicit model fine-tuning. I have also explored retrieval-augmented generation in the context of multilingual image captioning and in few-shot settings. I am now especially interested in multilingual NLP, currently working with LLMs for low-resource languages. 


Please find more detailed information in my [CV](cv2024.pdf).
